ForgeMultipart
==============

An API for dynamically handling different functional parts in the one block space.

Requirements:
* The latest version of [CodeChicken Lib (CCL)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/codechicken-lib-1-8)
* Forge
* A scala compatible IDE and project (For eclipse, download the scala eclipse plugin and right click on the project -> Add Scala Nature)

If you only want to use the API and not modify it:
 * Download the latest stable version from [Forge Multipart CBE on Curseforge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/forge-multipart-cbe) or latest development version from [Chicken Bones Mods](http://chickenbones.net/Pages/links.html)
 * Download the latest dev version of CCL.
 * Place both mods in your /libs/ folder and link them as libraries in your IDE.

Implementation of all parts of the API should be clean and easy in Java. The minecraft multipart mod is implemented in java as a test case.
